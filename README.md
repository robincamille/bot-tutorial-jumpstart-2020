# Twitter bot tutorial: Jumpstart Program 2020 edition

*See original repo: https://github.com/robincamille/bot-tutorial*

This tutorial and its updated materials were originally put together by Robin Davis (@robincamille) and Mark Eaton (github.com/MarkEEaton) for a pre-conference workshop at [Code4Lib 2018](http://2018.code4lib.org/).

April 2016. (Verbose write-up featuring [code from a previous version](https://github.com/robincamille/bot-tutorial) of this workshop.)

Written in Python 3.

**Required libraries:** tweepy 3.5, requests, time, os, random

## Create an account on PythonAnywhere

If you're participating in this in-person workshop:

1. Go to https://pythonanywhere.com and create an account by clicking on `Start running Python online in less than a minute`
 - Select `Create a beginner account` and fill out your details
 - Select `Account` on the top right
 - Select `Teacher` and enter `b7jl` so that we can add the sample code to your account

Bots left running on PythonAnywhere will keep running for a day or so (if the script you're using, like `mybot2.py`, is programmed to keep iterating through tweets) even if you close PythonAnywhere.

Not part of the in-person workshop? Download these files to your local machine or use this command: `git clone https://github.com/robincamille/bot-tutorial-code4lib.git`

## Create a Twitter account for your bot

1. Go to http://twitter.com and sign up for a new account of your choosing
 - Be sure to include your mobile number (required for using the API) 
 - Email address must be unique to Twitter users; try adding random periods in your Gmail address, if you have one

2. Go to http://apps.twitter.com and create a new app
 - This info isn't public so it can be messy 
 - Go to `Keys and Access Tokens`
 - `Create my access token`

3. Copy Consumer Key/Secret and Access Key/Secret to **credentials.template** and save as a new file named **credentials.py**

4. (Optional) Follow @bots4lib, which will follow & retweet bots made in this workshop

## Basic bot: mybot.py

This script is a basic Twitter bot. It will tweet three things from a **list** inside the script.

1. Go to the bot-tutorial-code4lib folder. Click on `mybot.py` to see the code

2. Take a look at the script; Robin and Mark will talk about what it's doing

3. Clicking `Run` will run the bot. A console will appear at the bottom of the screen with the output

*Change it up!*
- In `tweetlist`, add new things for your bot to tweet
- Increase/decrease time between tweets in `time.sleep(15)` (15 is the number of seconds) 

## Intermediate bot: mybot2.py

This script sends out five tweets from the first five lines of an external .txt file

1. Go to the bot-tutorial-code4lib folder. Click on `mybot2.py`

2. Also look at `twain.txt` to see the text

3. Take a look at both files; Robin and Mark will talk about what the script is doing

4. Select `Run`

*Change it up!*
 - Go to http://gutenberg.org and choose a different text for your bot to tweet. Pick the "Plain Text UTF-8" option when selecting a text format.
   - On PythonAnywhere, you can select `New Empty File`. This will only work if you've entered a filename. Copy and paste your gutenberg.org text (or any text of your choosing) into this blank file
   - Remove junk at the beginning (and the end) of the file. Save the file
   - Replace double linebreaks with single linebreaks. If your file is very short you can maybe do this manually.
   - For longer files you can click on `Open bash console here` and type: `cd bot-tutorial-code4lib` then `grep . filename > newfilename`. Open up the new file to make sure that it worked.
   - If you're on a Windows machine, the grep command above might not work as expected, because Windows handles line endings differently than Mac or linux systems. If you're having this problem, replace the grep command above with `grep -v "^[[:space:]]*$" filename > newfilename`
   - In mybot2.py, replace `twain.txt` with the `newfilename` 
 - Make the bot send more or fewer tweets, or change which lines, by editing the numbers in `for line in tweettext[0:5]`. 
   - `[0:5]` means from the first thing up to (but not including) the fifth thing
 
 
## Advanced bot: plumpoem.py

This script treats the poem *This Is Just To Say* (William Carlos Williams) as a mad-lib, filling in four blanks from four data sources: JSON files from @dariusk's [collection of corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora). 

*Change it up!*
- Choose different [word lists](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora). Make sure to change the URLs in lines ``16-19`` and the list name in lines ``22-25``.
- Choose a different piece of text to make into a mad lib. 


## Advanced bot: respondingbot.py

This script tweets a random line from a .txt file whenever @ocertat tweets.


## Advanced bot: mashup_markov

This script (markovmaker.py) uses a Markov chain to create a new file full of nonsense sentences from another text (twain.txt is included).

Use mybot2.py to tweet out lines from the new .txt file you created (note that the new filename is `mashup_markov/yourfilename.txt`).


## Advanced bot: imagebot.py

This bot makes a call to an images API, downloads an image, then tweets it with a caption drawn from a .txt file
